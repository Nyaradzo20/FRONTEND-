1.Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
Answer::::::
for(let i ="#"; i.length<=7; i +="#")
{
  console.log(i);
}

2.Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)
for(let i =1; i <=100; i++)
{
  if(i % 15 === 0){
  console.log("fizzbuzz");
  }
  else if(i % 5=== 0){
  console.log("fizz");
  }
  else if(i % 5 ===0)
 {
  console.log("buzz");
 }
